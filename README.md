# POAP Subgraph

This Subgraph sources events from the POAP contract in different networks.

## Deploying the subgraph:

**First time only**
```ssh
yarn install
```

Available networks: mainnet, xdai, sokol, kovan, ropsten 

```ssh
yarn prepare:<network>
yarn codegen
yarn build
yarn deploy:<network>
```

If you receive the next error while executing yarn deploy:<network>: 
âœ– Failed to deploy to Graph node https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/: Invalid account name or access token
 
Then you'd need to add --product hosted-service --access-token {TOKEN} just after graph deploy in the package json.
